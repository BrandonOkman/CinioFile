## Purpose
Movie lovers know the goosebumps a perfectly placed song can bring. That musical masterpiece is going to drive you crazy until you figure out exactly what it is, Luckily for you CinioFile is here. We bring all the songs you hear throughout your favorite Movies and TV Shows to you with the click of a button.

## User Story
* As a movie-watcher, I want to have an app where I can search up a movie and locate its soundtrack, so that I can listen to the songs outside of the movie.
* As a user, I want navigation buttons at the top of the app, so that I can quickly get to specific parts of the page that I'm looking for.
* As a user, I want a clean and easy-to-use UI, so that I can easily navigate and figure out what each button does.
* As a user, I want to be able to sign up for a premium app, so that I can get special features and be in the loop on new things for the app.
* As a user, I want to be able to share my findings on social media, so that my friends and family can try the app out for themselves.
* As a user, I want to have multiple platforms to download this app, so that I can access the app on any of my devices.
* As a user, I want a place to contact the app developers about issues and tips for the future, so that the app can be as efficient and effective as possible.
* As a user, I want to be able to access the portfolios of the app devs, so that I can find other projects that the devs have worked on.
